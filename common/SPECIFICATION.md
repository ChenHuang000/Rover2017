# Radio Communication Specification
The Xtend radios provide a bidirectional pipe between the rover and the computer (similar to a serial cable). Data is sent LSB first, just as in RS-232. This byte stream is divided into commands by special bytes. Each command has the following format:

\<start byte\>, \<command byte\>, [0 or more data bytes], \<end byte\>
  
Commands are delineated with start bytes and end bytes. If the rover encounters a start byte in the middle of a command, it discards the current command and begins receiving the new one. When a verbatim start or end byte needs to be transmitted as part of the data, it is prefixed with an escape byte. If an escape byte needs to be transmitted verbatim, it is also prefixed with an escape byte. The special bytes are:
  
Start - 0x01  
Escape - 0x02
End - 0x03

Commands are sent from the computer to the rover, and result in a reply from the rover to the computer. Command execution and the reply occur after an end byte is received. Conceptually, commands can be thought of as reading or writing values in the rover's memory. The MSB (bit 7, 0x80) of the command indicates whether that command is reading or writing (0 = writing, 1 = reading). When reading, the command should contain no data. Commands are acted upon as soon as the end byte is received.
For each command, the rover sends a reply containing the command (in the same read/write form as it received it) and any additional data. For write commands, no data is sent in the reply. For read commands, the requested data is sent in the reply. If the rover receives a command it does not recognize, it sends a reply with a command byte of 0x00. If the computer attempts to write a read-only register, the rover acts as if the write succeeded.
 
Multi-byte values are transmitted little-endian. Twoâ€™s complement is used for signed values.
In the following table, argument specifications begin with a code (i8 = 8-bit int, u16 = 16-bit unsigned int, etc) indicating the size of each argument. The leftmost argument is the first to the sent down the pipe.
Camera video data is transmitted through a separate interface. Camera commands and camera selection are sent through this command protocol.

Note: when adding commands to the table, each argument's name must be unique among all commands. Since they are used in the rover firmware,
don't change the name of existing command arguments.
